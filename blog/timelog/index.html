    <h1>The Randy Pausch&#39;s TimeLog</h1>
  
  <p class="subtitle"><time>2016-07-02</time></p>
  <p>TimeLog is a great tool of time management. Randy Pauch mentions how he use this time journal techniques.</p>
<p>One import technique is to make fake class or make fake schedule and pretend you are committed to that. You can work more efficiently with such a schedule.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Time journals. Time is the commodity, you better find out where your time is going. Monitor yourself and update it throughout the day. You can't wait till the end of the day and say: "What was I doing at 10:30?", because our memories aren't that good. So what you do - and I really hope that technology within another five years or so will be so good that the time journals can be created automatically or at least some facsimile of it, but until then what we do is, we monitor it ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is what an empty time journal would look like. The details aren't important but the key thing is that, when you fill it in, you've got a bunch of categories and what I was doing, and you can do this very informally but you'll get a lot of real data about where your time went. And it's always very different. Anybody who has done monetary budgeting, you look at it and you go, "Wow, I didn't know I was spending that much on dry cleaning." Or restaurants or whatever. It's always a fascinating surprise. And you always spend more than you think. But with time budgets, you find out that the time is going wildly differently than you would have imagined. The best example of this I know is Turing Award winner Fred Brooks's time clocks. He's a brilliant computer scientist but he also has this great array of clocks in his office, and when you go in and talk to him, he says: "Is this meeting about research or teaching?" or whatever, and then he flips the appropriate switch and at the end of the week he knows exactly where his time went. The man is a genius!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When I meet with students, and this is I think just as appropriate for people in a workplace, I say: "What's your schedule?" You have a set of fixed meetings every week and what you have to do is, you have to look at those and identify the open blocks where you're going to waste time, and I can tell you you're going to waste time just by looking at it. [He shows a picture of a schedule.] So in this case you've got a class where... you've got a class at a certain point, and then you've got a gap until the next class so I've identified those here. And the gaps between classes that in this case last an hour or an hour and a half, this is just prime time to be wasted! So what I always told my students was, make up a fake class. The fake class is, go to one specific place in the library during that hour and when you're sitting there with just you in the library and your books, there's a pretty good chance you might actually study. Don't go and hang out with friends for an hour, just make that a fake class, make your own little study hall. It's a simple trick, but it's amazing how effective it is when somebody just explicitly does it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you've got your time journal data, what do you figure out from that? What am I doing that doesn't need to be done? What can someone else do? I love every day saying, what am I doing that I could delegate to somebody else? My sister is again laughing because she knows who that person was in our youth. What can I do more efficiently? And: How am I wasting other people's time? When you get good at time management you realize that it's a collaborative thing. I want to make everybody more efficient, it's not a selfish thing, it's not me against you, it's: How do we all collectively get more done? As you push on the time journal stuff you start to find that you don't make yourself more efficient at work so you become some sort of √ºber-worker person, you become more efficient at work so you can leave at five and go home and be with the people that you love. People call this work-life balance. For the junior faculty, you may have heard of it in some sort of mythical sense but it is possible. I found that I worked less - I worked fewer hours after I got married and I got more done. And I was always fascinated in graduate school that the people who graduated fastest with their Ph.D.s were the people who had a spouse and kids. I said, how can that be? That's like a built-in boat anchor. You've got all these other demands on your time and I'm a single guy and I've got all the time in the world and that's the problem. I approach it like I've got all the time in the world so my time isn't precious. When you've got a spouse and little kids, your spouse is likely to say things to you like: "You better not be into that grad school more than 40 hours a week!", so when you come in, you're not sitting around playing computer games. Not that I ever did that! But when you come in, you're coming in and you're doing work and I found like most people that once I got married and had kids my whole view of time management really got - I mean, we were playing for real stakes now! Because now there are people whose lives are impacted if I'm spending too much time at work.</p>
