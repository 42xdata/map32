    <h2>Data-Driven Business: Planet Money&#39;s story on UPS</h2>
  
  <p class="subtitle"> 2016-06-17 </p>
  <p>NPR Planet Money is always my favourite podcast.</p>
<p>Today, I am listening <a href="http://j.mp/npr-ups">Episode 536: The Future Of Work Looks Like A UPS Truck</a>, <label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-0"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-0" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">It is a recurring podcast back to 2014.</span> an interesting story about how UPS tracks his drivers in every step <label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">It is also kind of creepy though.</span> and uses the enormous tracking information to optimize their business revenue.</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="290" scrolling="no" src="http://www.npr.org/player/embed/481295201/481305295" title="NPR embedded audio player" width="100%">
</iframe>
<p>You may though UPS was a truck or a delivery company. But, it is more like a tech company.</p>
<p>In UPS, every second of operation is tracked and analyzed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His truck is a rolling computer. Every step Bill takes, every mile he drives, it's tracked. From the time he punches in in the morning till he gets back to base at night, the company's trying to figure out how Bill can do his job quicker and more efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? Money.</p>
<div class="list-container"><ul>
<li>Just one minute per driver per day, over the course of a year, adds up to 14-and-a-half million dollars.</li>
<li>One keystroke per driver per day is about $100,000 - $100,00 a year.</li>
<li>One minute of idle per driver per day is worth about $500,000 of fuel at the end of the year.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>So, UPS exhausts every possible little changes to optimize every minute (e.g., replacing keys with key fobs and all other hundred little changes.). There is one profound difficult problem here---"if you have to make a bunch of stops, what's the most efficient order to make them in?"---known as the traveling salesman problem. Mathematicians and computer scientist have been studying versions of this problem for centuries. There is another constraint here in UPS's setting---different packages have different delivery times!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you had a package to your house by 10:30 - top of the list - the driver sees that. Your neighbor has one that's not due for the end of the day. That's on the list, but the driver has to decide, do I deliver your neighbor's house now or do I come back later to deliver your neighbor's house? And that's - that's a lot of complications, whether you realize it or not. You know, the number of ways is nearly unimaginable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that they have make some progress on this problem.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Maybe I can try to find the research paper somewhereü§î</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of people - a lot of them with PhDs - worked on this problem for years for UPS. And they are actually only solving it right now. They started rolling it out last year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually, UPS boosts the number of stops to deliver from around 90 to around 130. It is really a fantastic story of how a theoretical computing science problem impacts a big business in real world.</p>
<p>So, what is next? "UPS drivers can't be replaced by flying robots, by drones - at least not yet." But it is coming. The show ends with a significant message---"The UPS data guy, Jack Levis, he says the company is working on it."</p>
